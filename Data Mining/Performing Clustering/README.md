# For this lab our goals were to,
    - The main object of this lab is to be able to evaluate off-the-shelf clustering algorithms. This will be based on the characteristics of dataset and the outcome needed. 
    - This objective will be accomplished by evaluating three datasets and decide what is suitable to represent them.
    - Finally, we shall be capable of understanding how to tune and evaluate a clusteting algorithm to achieve good performance.
    - For such we will perform the following calculations
      - Runtime of algorithm
      - Cohesion(WSS) and Separation(BSS)
      - Sum of Squared Error (SSE)
