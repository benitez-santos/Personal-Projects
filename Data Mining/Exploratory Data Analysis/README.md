# Exploratory Data Analysis
### The objective of this lab was to practice with the basic elements of working with datasets.
### As we know, data is never clean and it's up to the implementor to fix it.
### In this lab we experiment with heatmaps and finding correlations between various features
### Along with noise and the scalability of your data, correlation can affect your analysis
### That one feature(s) can add unnecessary redundant information that give false conclusions
