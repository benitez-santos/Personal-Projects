#  Instant Messaging Platform 
- The following was intended to represent a messaging system 
- The Following is a guide on how to run my code for the following project
- For my implementation the username and password should be less than 20 characters. The message can be 79 characters. Also, user shouldn't use the character '|' as this is a terminal character for the server to know when to stop readying. 

To Register, the R should be capitalized and the username and password can be in brackets if needed
- Register \<username\> \<password\>
- Register username password

To Login, the L should be capitalized and the username and password can be in brackets if needed
- Register \<username\> \<password\>
- Register username password

To Logout, the L should be capitalized and the username can be in brackets if needed
- Logout \<username\> 
- Logout username 

To get the List, the L should be capitalized (only one way to put it in)
- List

To send the Message, the M should be capitalized and the username and message can be in brackets if needed
- Message \<username\> \<message\>
- Message username message
